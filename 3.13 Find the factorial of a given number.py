#Write a program to use the loop to find the factorial of a given number.
#The factorial (symbol: !) means to multiply all
#whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1.
#For example: calculate the factorial of 5
#5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

z = 5
y = 1

for i in range(1, 6):
	y = y * i
print (y)
